2) Compile the source and create the jar file (shib2-logout-X.X.jar) from it.
   (This may require additional jars from your Shibboleth IdP.)
   
   mvn -DskipTests install 

2) Next copy the resulting target/shib2-logout-X.X.jar to the lib subdirectory 
   of your Shibboleth IdP's setup directory.
3) Copy the *.jsp templates from the resources directory to your webapp folder 
   (please note that these examples may be customized by you as you like).
4) In your webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml , add the following lines:

    <!-- Servlet for performing IdP logout. -->
    <servlet>
        <servlet-name>Shib2Logout</servlet-name>
        <servlet-class>org.extreme.shib2.logout.LogoutServlet</servlet-class>
        <load-on-startup>2</load-on-startup>
    </servlet>

    <servlet-mapping>

the address above to complete the IdP session destruction logout that this
servlet provides.

=======
Optionally you can change the names of the jsp pages used by setting these 
init parameters in web.xml when you define the logout servlet.

          <param-name>logoutPage</param-name>
          <param-value>yourpage.jsp</param-value>
        </init-param>
